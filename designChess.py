# Prompt: You are building a GUI based chess game between two players. You are responsible for implementing the following backend API which the front end can call:
# Function 1 (Initialization):
# Input: None
# Output: Error or success
# Function 2 (provide the state of the board): 
# Input: None
# Output: A list of all the available pieces on the board and their locations
# Function 3 (given a move, determine if can be performed and if it can be then perform the move):
# Input: A pieces, itâ€™s starting location and ending location
# Output:
# Either an invalid error (with reason)
# Or return valid move
# Chess description
# Chess is a game played between two players: black and white on a 8x8 board
# Each player has the following pieces:
# 8 Knights
# 8 pawns
# Each piece has a particular way that it can move
# Knight: Do a as many as needed forwad/backward/left/right step. 
# Pawn: Can move 1 step forward and 1 step sideways to remove piece from other team
