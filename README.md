# Data-Structures-Algorithms-in-Python
These consist of solutions/coding samples for a [Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python--ud513) I completed for Data Structures &amp; Algorithms in Python. 

UPDATE - Now this repository is a continuous accumulation of solutions of the coding questions that I have done on Leetcode and Pramp. 


Coding Interview Guidelines- 
1) Clarifying the question (what the actual problem is that you are trying to solve)
2) Genrating inputs and outputs (sample inputs and outputs)
3) Generating test cases (boundary cases like empty inputs or None input)
4) Brainstorming (letting them know how you are thinking of the solution - the interviewer is on your side, take their help, it shows teamwork skills)
5) Runtime analysis (check to see if the algorithm you have proposed is optimal)
6) Writing Pseudocode
7) Coding (explain steps while coding to show you are actually thinking and this is not a memorized solution)
8) Debugging (going through it again and Checking whether your code actually works)


Interview Question Goals:

Validate Job Description
Learn more about company
Understand tech landscape and roadmap (current vs. future state of technical environment)
Determine the operations of the company: how they do things
Capture key priorities/expectations - in like 3-6 months and in a year
Identify success criteria - top skills required
Determine interest - 
Identify manager concerns about candidacy and plan how to overcome - concerns about my background
How will a day look like for me in this role?
