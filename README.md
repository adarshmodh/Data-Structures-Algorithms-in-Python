# Data-Structures-Algorithms-in-Python
These consist of solutions/coding samples for a [Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python--ud513) I completed for Data Structures &amp; Algorithms in Python. 

UPDATE - Now this repository is a continuous accumulation of solutions of the coding questions that I have done on Leetcode and Pramp. 

## Coding Interview Guidelines- 
1) Clarifying the question (what the actual problem is that you are trying to solve)
2) Genrating inputs and outputs (sample inputs and outputs)
3) Generating test cases (boundary cases like empty inputs or None input)
4) Brainstorming (letting them know how you are thinking of the solution - the interviewer is on your side, take their help, it shows teamwork skills)
5) Runtime analysis (check to see if the algorithm you have proposed is optimal)
6) Writing Pseudocode
7) Coding (explain steps while coding to show you are actually thinking and this is not a memorized solution)
8) Debugging (going through it again and Checking whether your code actually works)

## Coding Style guidelines - 
* Class names start with upper case, capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word.
* Function and variable names start with lower case, capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word.
* If it is a class/struct data member, add “_” at the end of the variable name. So that we can easily see it is not a local one.
* In general, we don’t put type info into class name or variable name or class name.
* Indent is 2 space. Avoid using tabs for indent since it looks disorganized in different editors. All reasonable editor/IDE has a way to replace tab with space.
* Do not add &quot;using namespace XXX&quot; in any header.
* Avoid including &lt;QtCore&gt; &lt;QtGui&gt; kind of header in library level header. Since they will drag in very
* long list of includes and slow down the compilation for all dependents.
* Avoid too many unnecessary change of lines. If-else block, for block, please don’t change lines 2 or 3 times. It just causes us to scroll up and down more.
* By convention class member variables are kept always private. And modified by setXXXX functions. Accessed by XXXX() const functions
* return codes from main() functions are interpreted as 0 for success 1 for error.

## Interview Question Goals:

* Validate Job Description
* Learn more about company
* Understand tech landscape and roadmap (current vs. future state of technical environment)
* Determine the operations of the company: how they do things
* Capture key priorities/expectations - in like 3-6 months and in a year
* Identify success criteria - top skills required
* Determine interest 
* Identify manager concerns about candidacy and plan how to overcome - concerns about my background
* How will a day look like for me in this role?
