iterate through words :

Time - O(n)
Space - O(n)

For sorting:
 as for the sorting part, rather than sorting the entries in the map directly, which takes O(Mâ‹…log(M)) - where M is number of unique words in document - a better solution will be to place words into an array of string arrays indexed by the occurrence number and then iterate through the array in the reverse order. This is similar to a Bucket Sort. The proposed solution trades off a bit of space for performance, which may be a reasonable trade under certain circumstances.
